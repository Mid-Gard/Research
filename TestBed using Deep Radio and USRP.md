## Alternatives to OpenBTS for creating a local GSM and SMS network using USRP hardware on Ubuntu Linux, there are a few options you can consider:

1. **OsmocomBB  with OsmoBTS:**
   OsmocomBB is an open-source implementation of GSM baseband software. It can be used in combination with OsmoBTS to create a GSM network. While it might not provide all the features of OpenBTS, it's a solid alternative for basic GSM network setup.

Based on the search results, here are some resources and projects related to simulating LTE using Deep Radio or SDR:

1. [LTE Transmitter Using Software Defined Radio](https://www.mathworks.com/help/lte/ug/lte-transmitter-using-software-defined-radio-sdr.html): This example from MathWorks demonstrates how to generate a reference measurement channel (RMC) downlink LTE waveform suitable for over-the-air transmission using a software-defined radio (SDR). It also shows how to transmit the generated waveform using single or multiple antennas.

2. [Image Transmission and Reception Using LTE Waveform and SDR](https://www.mathworks.com/help/lte/ug/image-transmission-reception-using-lte-waveform-and-sdr.html): This example from MathWorks explains how to import an image file and pack it into multiple radio frames of a baseband RMC waveform generated by the LTE Toolbox. It demonstrates continuous RF LTE waveform transmission using a supported SDR and captures the resultant waveform using the same SDR. It also supports simulating an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel or passing the waveform directly to the decode stage with no impairments if an SDR is not available.

3. [Teaching LTE, LTE-Advanced With a Hands-On Test Bed in DreamCatcherâ€™s LimeSDR-Powered Courseware](https://limemicro.com/community/teaching-lte-lte-advanced-with-a-hands-on-test-bed-in-dreamcatchers-limesdr-powered-courseware/): This resource discusses a courseware package developed by DreamCatcher that uses LimeSDR USB and LimeSDR Mini to implement LTE and LTE-Advanced cellular networks. The courseware provides hands-on experience with building a standalone LTE network and includes teaching slides, training kits, lab sheets, and problem-based assignments.

4. [Analyzing TD-LTE with the RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tag/lte/): This article explains how Jiao Xianjun modified the LTE-Cell-Scanner program to support TD-LTE and used it with MATLAB scripts and an RTL-SDR to decode cell information from TD-LTE signals. It demonstrates the use of RTL-SDR for analyzing TD-LTE networks.

5. [Software-Defined Radio Lab at Wireless Institute](https://wireless.nd.edu/about/software-defined-radio-sdr-lab/): The Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Lab at the Wireless Institute provides platforms and testbed capability for prototyping wireless communication systems. It uses National Instrument's integrated hardware and software solution, including USRP RIO (USRP-2953R) 2x2 MIMO hardware units, LabVIEW Communications environment, LTE and 802.11 Application Software Frameworks, and PXI Express chassis.

These resources should provide you with a good starting point for simulating LTE using Deep Radio or SDR.
