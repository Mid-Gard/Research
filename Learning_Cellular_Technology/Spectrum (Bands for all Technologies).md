#### For 3G and 4G it was B, but for 5G it started with n why is that

The letter codes used to designate frequency bands in different cellular technologies, such as 3G, 4G, and 5G, are part of the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) standard, which is a collaboration between telecommunications standards organizations to develop protocols for mobile telecommunications.

The letter codes are used to categorize frequency bands and indicate the "band number" that a particular frequency range falls under. The choice of letters or prefixes like "B" for 3G and 4G and "n" for 5G is based on historical development and evolution of cellular technologies, and each generation introduces its own nomenclature. Let's dive into the reasons behind the choice of prefixes:

**3G and 4G Bands (e.g., B1, B2, etc.):**
- The "B" in 3G and 4G bands stands for "Band," and it's followed by a number (e.g., B1, B2, B3) that corresponds to a specific frequency range. This numbering scheme was adopted to simplify the identification of different bands and their frequency ranges within the context of 3G and 4G technologies.

**5G Bands (e.g., n1, n2, etc.):**
- The "n" in 5G bands stands for "New Radio," which refers to the new air interface introduced in 5G technology. The New Radio (NR) interface is a key component of 5G and represents a significant departure from the radio interfaces used in 3G and 4G.
- The use of "n" indicates that 5G is a departure from previous cellular generations and introduces a new foundation for wireless communication. It's a way to differentiate the distinctive nature of 5G technology from its predecessors.

In summary, the change from "B" to "n" in the naming of cellular bands between 4G and 5G reflects the introduction of a new air interface and technology foundation in 5G. The "n" in 5G bands indicates that a new radio technology is being employed compared to the evolution from 2G to 3G to 4G. This kind of naming convention helps both industry professionals and the general public differentiate between different generations of cellular technology and their underlying technical advancements.
