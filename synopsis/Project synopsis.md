[[Hardware Components]]

# Sensors:

Sensors (Soil, Temperature, Humidity, Livestock Health) gather data from the farm environment.

# Actuators:

Actuators (Pumps, Fans, Sprinklers, Feeders, etc.) control devices on the farm.

# Cellular IoT Network:

- Sensors and actuators are connected to the Cellular IoT Network.
- This network facilitates real-time data transmission from sensors to the cloud and allows remote control of actuators.

# IoT Bridge (Gateway):

- Connects the Cellular IoT Network to the Cloud Platform.
- Manages data transmission, ensuring secure and efficient communication.

# Real-time Data Collection:

- Data collected from the sensors is sent to the Cloud Platform.
- This data is stored in the cloud for further analysis.

# **Autonomous Vehicles (Future Expansion):**

- Unmanned Ground Vehicle and Autonomous Drone are envisioned for farm operations.
- These vehicles can be used for tasks such as monitoring crops and livestock.

# **Data Analysis (ML & AI):**

- Data collected from sensors is processed using Machine Learning and AI algorithms.
- Predictive analytics and decision-making insights are generated based on this analysis.

# **Cloud Platform:**

- Data from sensors is stored in the Cloud Platform (e.g., Google Cloud, Amazon Cloud).
- Data analysis results are also stored for access and visualization.
- This represents cloud services such as Google Cloud or Amazon Cloud where the collected data is stored and analyzed.

# APP:
1. **Remote Control Interface:**
    - The Remote Control Interface allows users to control actuators on the farm remotely.
    - This interface is connected to the Cloud Platform, enabling remote interaction.
2. **Farm Management Dashboard:**
    - The Farm Management Dashboard provides real-time insights from the collected data.
    - Users can monitor the farm's status, make informed decisions, and adjust settings through this dashboard.
3. **Remote Control & Dashboard:** The **Remote Control** and **Farm Management Dashboard** components are combined into one section. This integration allows users to both remotely control actuators and monitor the farm's status through a single interface.
